# Hidden Markov Model

### Stochastic Process
The sequence of random variables

### Markov Process
A stochastic process that has Markov property

### Markov Property
memoryless property

### Sensor Model
the state of a system cannot be directly measured

### Hidden Markov Model
Combining a Markov chain with the sensor model

### Inference tasks
- Filtering
- Prediction
- Smoothing
- Most likely explanation
