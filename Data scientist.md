get the initial idea

standarize to be std = 1

correlation analysis

forward and backward attribute selection

forward selection: train on one attribute first, add more

PCA: principal component analysis

## clustering
k-mean


Baseline accuracy

classification
- k nearest neighbor
- decision tree
- support vector machine
- logistic regression
