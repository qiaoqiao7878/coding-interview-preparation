- Generating inputs and outputs
- Generating test cases -> None and empty value
- Brainstorming
- Runtime Analysis
- Coding
- Debugging


Websites:
- HackerRank: Website and community with programming challeges that you can go through for additional practice.
- Project Euler: This website has a ton of logic problems that you can practice writing coded solutions to.
- Interview Cake: Practice questions and some tutorials available.
- Interactive Python: Loads of tutorials on pretty much every topic covered here and many more, along with Python examples and concept questions.
- Topcoder: New practice problems every day, and some tech companies use answers to those problems to find new potential hires.
- LeetCode: Practice problems, mock interviews, and articles about problems.
- BigO Cheat Sheet: Summary of efficiencies for most common algorithms and data structures.

Online Courses:
- Intro to Algorithms Course on Udacity: The course you just completed is essentially a prerequisite of the Intro to Algorithms course. Intro to Algorithms is largely about graph algorithmsâ€”you likely won't need most of them for interviews, but if you're interested in graph algorithms this is a great next step!
